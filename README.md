# "AUSTRALIAN BUSHFIRE" ONE PAGE SITE

## REFLECTION:

The “Australian Bushfire” one page website was made to inform and educate about the history, and impacts of bushfires in Australia as well as to provide instructions and information on the situation, using Javascript as a design accompaniment to HTML and CSS.

Having learned about HTML and CSS before this unit, creating the structure for the website was not the challenging part. In the beginning, I was engrossed in styling CSS and creating animation effects using CSS as I had more insight into it. Since the unit is all about learning and using Javascript, I was pushed to add more effects to demonstrate the Javascript skill I have developed throughout the unit. After doing research and watching tutorials, I got more ideas about how I can apply Javascript to the design.

Most of my Java codes use “querySelector” or “addEventListener”. These are used to show/hide specific elements at exact positions or change CSS style. I have also used mouse/click functions to add effects to the cursor,  and used scroll functions to add effects to the navigation bar.

I had no Javascript experience at the start of the semester, but I spent a lot of time studying and working on this website continuously throughout the project. Overall, I am pleased with the final design, although I would like to revisit some of the concepts.

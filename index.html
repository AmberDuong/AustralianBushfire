            <h2>WHAT IS BUSHFIRE?</h2>
            <div class="hidden">
                <p>Bushfires in Australia are a widespread and regular occurrence that have contributed significantly to shaping the nature of the continent 
                    over millions of years. Eastern Australia is one of the most fire-prone regions of the world, and its predominant eucalyptus forests have                             
                    evolved to thrive on the phenomenon of bushfire. However, the fires can cause significant property damage and loss of both human and animal life.                         
                    Bushfires have killed approximately 800 people in Australia since 1851, and billions of animals.

                    <h3 class="title">Weather</h3>
                    <p class="text">In recent times most major bush fires have been started in remote areas by dry lightning. During periods 
                        of drought, the fuel for wildfires is greater than normal, and bushfires combine to become megafires, 
                        generating their own weather and spreading fire further. Strong winds also promote the rapid spread of 
                        fires by lifting burning embers into the air.

                    <h3 class="title">Natural phenomena</h3>
                    <p class="text">Large, violent wildfires can generate winds of themselves, called fire whirls. Fire whirls are like tornadoes 
                        and result from the vortices created by the fire's heat. These whirls have been known to hurl flaming logs and 
                        burning debris over considerable distances. In the Northern Territory fires can also be spread by black kites, 
                        whistling kites and brown falcons. These birds have been spotted picking up burning twigs, flying to areas of 
                        unburned grass and dropping them to start new fires there. This exposes their prey attempting to flee the blazes: 
                        small mammals, birds, lizards, and insects.

                    <h3 class="title">Topography</h3>
                    <p class="text">Flat/grassland fires burn along flat plains or areas of small undulation, predominantly covered in grasses or scrubland. 
                        These fires can move quickly, fanned by high winds in flat topography, and they quickly consume the small amounts of 
                        fuel/vegetation available.

                    <h3 class="title">Climate change</h3>
                    <p class="text">Australia's climate has warmed by more than one degree Celsius over the past century, causing an increase in the 
                        frequency and intensity of heatwaves and droughts. Heatwaves and droughts dry out the undergrowth and create 
                        conditions that increase the risk of bushfires. The bushfires have not only been made more likely and intense by 
                        climate change, but they also add to it. They will increase Australia's annual greenhouse gas emissions, contributing 
                        to global warming, and heighten the likelihood of recurring megafires that will release yet more emissions. This is a 
                        deeply concerning climate feedback loop.

                    <p class="text">Bushfires in Australia can occur all year-round, though the severity and the "bushfire season" varies by region. 
                        Bushfire seasons are commonly grouped into years such as "2019-2020 Australian bushfire season" and typically 
                        apply to the season for southern and eastern Australia; from 1 June to 31 May annually.

                    <p class="text">In the last ten years, government licenses have been granted to fire-prevention programs on Aboriginal lands in 
                        northern Australia. Since this process began, destructive bushfires in northern Australia have burned 57% fewer 
                        acres in 2019 than they did on average in the years from 2000 to 2010, the decade before the program started. 
                        Oliver Costello from the national Indigenous Firesticks Alliance stated that in southern Australia, Aboriginal 
                        knowledge systems of fire management are less valued than in the north.

                            • Where possible, prepare a firebreak around the home. <br>
                            • Trim branches so that they are well clear of the house. <br>
                            • Clear roof gutters of leaves and twigs. <br>
                            • Store wood, fuel and paints etc well clear of the house. <br>
                            • Remove rubbish, leaf litter and plants that are close to the house <br>
                            • Keep grassed areas (especially those around the house) short/ green. <br>
                            • Fit wire screens to doors, windows and vents (to prevent burning embers from entering the house). <br>
                            • Enclose any gaps, roof eaves and the under area of the house. <br>
                            • Keep a ladder nearby for roof access (both inside and out). <br>
                            • Have water hoses available and ensure they will reach all parts of the house and garden. Where water is not connected, obtain a high pressure pump. <br>
                            • Decide on a household plan to either leave early or stay to protect the properly prepared home during the bushfire.<br>

                            • Phone the bushfire brigade - do not assume they know about the fire. <br>
                            • Fill baths, sinks, buckets etc with reserve water and turn off any gas and power. <br>
                            • Remove curtains and move furniture away from windows. <br>
                            • Wear protective clothing that covers the body area, solid boots or shoes, a hat or woollen balaclava and gloves. <br>
                            • Plug downpipes with rags and fill all roof gutters with water. Hose down walls, garden etc on the sides of the house facing the 'fire-front' and watch for spot fires. <br>
                            • Inside, close all windows, doors and block crevices and gaps. When the fire front arrives, stay inside, away from windows, while it passes (usually 5-15 minutes). <br>
                            • Quickly extinguish any fires, which may have started in, on, or under the house and check inside the roof cavity. <br> 
                            • If the house is alight and can't be extinguished, move away to safe burnt ground. Don't leave the area, wait for help. Listen to the battery radio for official information.<br>

                            • Flat ground is safer than sloping ground <br>
                            • Gentle slopes are safer than steep slopes <br>
                            • The bottom of the slope is safer than the top. <br>
                            • Slopes facing east are safer than slopes facing north, northwest, west or south. <br>
                            • Establish fire breaks (preferably ploughed) between any unmanaged grass or bushland/forest if a natural firebreak (such as a road or river) does not exist. <br>
                            • The firebreak should encircle the homesite and the wider it is the better. <br> 
                            • Minimise grass fuel and fuel in timbered areas within 60 meters of the homesite by controlled burning and slashing. <br>
                            • Position the homesite so that any forested areas are to the south and east of the site. <br>
                            • Position high-moisture content trees on the hazard prone side of the site to act as a shield against radiated heat and flying sparks and embers. <br>
                            • Put sheds to the south and east of the homesite and ensure the entrances face east. <br> 
                            • Isolate inflammable fuel from the homesite and hay shed 4.
